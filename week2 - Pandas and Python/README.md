# Colab and Python Notebooks

Your teaching assistants will show you the following:
- Revisit where all code is saved in github.
- Revisit how to load in Colab a file from github.
- How to autocomplete Python code in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#)

## Goals:

- Learn how to load different types of dataset
- Load some csv files from the /data in our github. What is the dataset about? What is the numerosity, what is the dimensionality of the dataset? 
- Learn how to convert columns in the appropriate datatype.
- Learn how to do basic operations using the dataframe in Python.

## Hour 1
1. revision of Python: [Python_Tutorial.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week2%20-%20Pandas%20and%20Python/Python_Tutorial.ipynb)

2. **(At home)** complete the tasks from here: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)


## Hour 2

Open the following file to learn about: [Basic_Pandas_Load_File.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week2%20-%20Pandas%20and%20Python/Basic_Pandas_Load_File.ipynb)

We will cover:
- Pandas
- load a csv and JSON file to a Pandas dataframe
- How to load data from an API on the web (**new**)
- do some basic selection/filtering operations with pandas (columns and rows)
    - filtering by rows
    - filtering by columns
- convert columns to proper datatype
- remove rows with nulls    

**At home:** (Really! do all of them otherwise you will not be able to follow!)
Complete all the walkthroughs (01-04) and the exercise in the [Pandas](https://github.com/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/tree/master/week2%20-%20Pandas%20and%20Python/Pandas) folder by opening them in colab
