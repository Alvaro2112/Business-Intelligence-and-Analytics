        "* **Boolean Indexing** or **Boolean Selection** is the selection of a subset of a Series/DataFrame based on the values themselves and not the row/column labels or integer location\n",
        "* Boolean selection is used to answer common queries like \"find all the female engineers with a salary over 150k/year\"\n",
        "* To do boolean selection, you first create a sequence of True/False values and pass it to a DataFrame/Series indexer\n",
        "* Each row of data is kept or discarded\n",
        "* The indexing operators are **overloaded** - change functionality depending on what is passed to them\n",
        "* Typically, you will first create a boolean Series with one of the 6 comparison operators\n",
        "* You will pass this boolean series to one of the indexers to make your selection\n",
        "* Use the **`isin`** method to test for multiple equalities in the same column\n",
        "* Use **`isnull`** to find all rows with missing values in a particular column\n",
        "* Can use the **`between`** Series method to test whether Series values are within a range\n",
        "* You can create complex criteria with the **and** (**`&`**), **or** (**`|`**), and **not** (**`~`**) logical operators\n",
        "* When you have multiple conditions in a single line, you must wrap each expression with a parentheses\n",
        "* If you have complex criteria, think about storing each set of criteria into its own variable (i.e. don't do everything in one line)\n",
        "* If you are only selecting rows, then you will almost always use *just the indexing operator*\n",
        "* If you are simultaneously doing boolean selection on the rows and selecting column labels then you will use **`.loc`**\n",
        "* You will almost never use **`.iloc`** to do boolean selection\n",
        "* Boolean selection works the same for Series as it does for DataFrames"
