        "## Part 4: How NOT to select subsets of data\n",
        "This is part 4 of the series \"How to Select Subsets of Data\" from a pandas DataFrame or Series. Pandas offers a wide variety of options for subset selection, which necessitates multiple articles. This series is broken down into the following topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning what not to do\n",
        "In all programming languages, and especially pandas, the number of incorrect or inefficient ways to complete a task heavily outnumbers the efficient or **idiomatic** ones. The term idiomatic refers to code that is efficient, easy to understand, and a common way (among experts) to accomplish a task in a particular library/language. \n",
        "\n",
        "The first three parts of this series showed the idiomatic way of making selections. In this section, we will cover the most common ways users incorrectly make subset selections. Some of these bad habits might be perfectly acceptable in other Python libraries, but will be unacceptable with pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Getting the right answer with the wrong code\n",
        "One of the issues that prevents users from learning idiomatic pandas, is that it is still possible to get the correct final result while using highly inefficient and non-idiomatic code. Completing a task isn't necessarily indicative that your code is correct.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few reasons why a solution that gives the correct result might not be good:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A slow solution might not scale to larger data\n",
        "* A solution might work in this particular instance but fail with slightly different data\n",
        "* A solution might be very fast, but hard to interpret by others\n",
        "\n",
        "## Chained indexing with lists\n",
        "**Chained indexing** is the first and most important subset selection problem we will discuss. Chained indexing occurs whenever two subset selections immediately following each other. \n",
        "\n",
        "To help simplify the idea, we will look at chained indexing with Python lists. Let's first create a list of integers:"
